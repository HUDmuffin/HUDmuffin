# Welcome to the HUDmuffin Project Repository Page!

##This is the AR App coding Repository page.
##In this repository you may be able to commit code related to the Unity3D App used to present the actual app on the phone (at least this is the target for this project)
## This code will need to pull its data from the API available at the Backend repository
##Below are some Tutorials on Git/Github provided as courtisy from our fellow member Robert (big thanks!)
